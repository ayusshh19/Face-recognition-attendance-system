# Face Recognition Attendance System
### Problem Statement
Traditional student attendance marking technique is often facing a lot of
trouble. The face recognition student attendance system emphasizes its
simplicity by eliminating classical student attendance marking technique such as calling student names or checking respective identification cards. There are not
only disturbing the teaching process but also causes distraction for students
during exam sessions. Apart from calling names, attendance sheet is passed
around the classroom during the lecture sessions. The lecture class especially the
class with a large number of students might find it difficult to have the attendance
sheet being passed around the class. Thus, face recognition attendance system is
proposed in order to replace the manual signing of the presence of students which
are burdensome and causes students get distracted in order to sign for their
attendance. Furthermore, the face recognition based automated student
attendance system able to overcome the problem of fraudulent approach and
lecturers does not have to count the number of students several times to ensure
the presence of the students.

### Project Flow
>1. Register your account and add your dataset through face detection.
>2. Train the model so that it can learn from the face dataset and store the fundamentals.
>3. Mark your attendance through video capture .
>4. Visual check of your attendance records
